# Rember Game Arduino 
## Idea
This is game for **Arduino** where user have some **boxs**. In each box will be **button and diod LED**.
The game will have two modes.
### First Mode
The first mode is **"rember mode"**. Computer will show **random sequence** by led.
User must **repete** sequence by **button**. Computer at the beginning show only first sequence and when user good repete sequence.
Computer will show the next sequence etc. As long as user to mistake and repete bad seqence. Then the games end.
### Second Mode
The second mode is **"Music mode"**. Where in mobile app show color which user must repete by button. When user click button music is coming out.
